PREQUISITES:
------------

1. Classpath (http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/) should be installed.
   The location of the .so files of Classpath should be included in 
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH or in /etc/ld.so.conf. (IMPORTANT NOTE: It is assumed that classpath
   is installed in /usr/local. Even if it is not, please create a symlink in /usr/local
   that points to the actual installation directory) 

2. Set the CLASSPATH environment variable to include classpath.jar (present in this directory) 

   This is required because Vajra currently cannot use Classpath's 
   glibj.zip. classpath.jar is functionally identical to glibj.zip (v0.09)

3. Edit the makefile so that the following variables are set to the correct
   values:

   JAVAC
   JAR
   GCCDIR
   INCLUDEDIRS
   LIBDIRS

INSTALLATION:
-------------

1. Run 'make' to build vajra.
2. Add the current directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH or /etc/ld.so.conf (as the case
   may be).
3. Run 'make Test' to run the test classes.
